  - When a player is asked for a card that they have, they must surrender the card, and it remains the asking player's turn.
  - When a player is asked for a card that they do not have, it becomes the asked player's turn.
3. When a player on either team believes their team possesses all the cards in a given set, they may declare:
  - When a player declares a set, they must identify the number and location of each card in that set.
  - If the player declares correctly, their team scores a point for the declared set.
  - If the player declares incorrectly, but their team possesses all the cards in the declared set, the set is forfeit (removed from the game), and neither team scores points for that set.
  - If the player declares incorrectly, and the other team possesses one or more of the cards in the set, the point is awarded to the opposing team.
4. When a team is out of cards, each player on the opposing team has one last chance to declare for their team.
5. The team with the most valid sets wins!


## Official Rules

### 6-Player (Original) Version

#### Setup

Players divided into two teams of three, sitting alternating or with teams opposing each other, depending on the seating arrangement. The 54 cards are dealt out to the players evenly, so that each player receives 9 cards.

#### Objective

The game is divided into 9 different suits or "sets", each of which bare a different identifying symbol. The sets each contain 6 numbered cards (1-6). The objective of the game is to collect more sets than the opposing team.

#### Gameplay

Players take turns asking a single opponent for a specific card. **In order to ask for a card, the asking player must possess at least one other card in the same set**. A player must not ask for a card that they possess, and a player must surrender a card they possess if asked for it by an opponent. Players must not show or discuss the contents of their hands with any other player (i.e., "table talk" is prohibited).

The player to the left of the dealer goes first, asking a player on the opposing team for a card. When a player is asked for a card that they have, they must surrender the card, and it remains the asking player's turn. When a player is asked for a card that they do not have, it becomes the asked player's turn.

When a player on either team believes their team possesses all the cards in a given set, they may declare. When a player declares a set, they must identify the number and location of each card in that set. If the player declares correctly, their team scores a point for the declared set. If the player declares incorrectly, but their team possesses all the cards in the declared set, the set is forfeit (removed from the game), and neither team scores points for that set. If the player declares incorrectly, and the other team possesses one or more of the cards in the set, the point is awarded to the opposing team. Declaration must happen between turns (i.e., a player may not declare after another player has asked a question, but before an answer has been given from the opposing team).

When a player surrenders their final card to an opponent (or their final card is removed from the game due to declaration of a set), that player may no longer ask for cards. They *may*, however, still declare for their team. If a player's last card is removed while it would still be that player's turn, that player may select a player on their team to play next.

#### Game End and Scoring

When a team has no cards remaining, the opposing team may no longer ask any questions, nor may they discuss with their teammates about their hands. Each player on the remaining team has one chance to declare remaining sets for their team. Players may forfeit this turn, but the very last player must declare or else the team forfeits the rest of the points. Play passes to the left from the most recent player.

After all players are out of cards, valid sets are tallied up, and the team with the most sets wins.


### 4-Player Version

*Note: the 4-player version is a bit more advanced, so it's recommended that you play the game a few times with 6 players before attempting the 4-player version.*

#### Setup

The 4-player setup is almost the same as with 6 players. You still deal 6 piles of 9 cards each, but you leave two piles face down, and merge them into one pile (the "Pile") before starting the game.

### Gameplay

Gameplay works the same as with 6 players, except when a player declares, they may declare that the Pile has one or more of the cards (in this case, the Pile assumes the role of a teammate on the declaring player's team).

*TODO: clarify the rules for when a player declares incorrectly against the Pile*


### FAQ

##### When a player runs out of cards on their turn, how is the next player determined?
The player whose turn it is chooses a player on their team (who still has cards) to take the next turn.

##### How is play order determined when all players in the opposing team are out of cards?
Play passes to the left, starting with the most recent player.


### Variations

#### 8-Players

It is possible to play with 8 players, though the game can get exceptionally difficult. The rules are the same as with 6 players, but the cards are dealt in a circle until they run out, so not all players will start with the same number of cards (optionally, you can remove one entire set so that everyone starts with an even 6 cards).

#### Limited Declarations

To make the game a little more challenging, you can opt to play where players may only declare on their turn. After the declaration is resolved, the player's turn continues. This introduces some interesting strategy.

#### Strict Declarations

In the normal game, if you declare incorrectly, but your team has all of the cards in the set, the point is merely forfeit. You can opt to play so that the opposing team gets the point if the declaration is incorrect in *any* way, even if that team does not possess any of the cards in that set.
